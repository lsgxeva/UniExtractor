 trying to editing ramdisk of our redmi 1s kernel but it always failed in repacking, after hours of search i was able to find a perfect tool which can unpack/repack kernel perfectly by Cofface (Win Version) and Xiaolu (Linux Version) (recommended) 
 So no more talk here how to

Windows User :

You don't need to do much..i already made a batch file
 simply paste your kernel/boot.img in a folder with the tool (see attachment)
and then

*To unpack the kernel
 open unpack_bootimg.bat

*To repack the kernel
 open repack_bootimg.bat

that's it.. enjoy editing 

Note : This will only works for redmi 1s kernel.... to make work on other device see post 2
